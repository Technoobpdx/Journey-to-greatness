# Journey-to-greatness
I want to build a Smart app but I have no idea so a began with AI and it began with a python code for the data I collected..now it time to learn!
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
data = [20, 1.11, 13.4] # in billions
total = sum(data) # in billions
labels = ["Economy", "Business", "Consumer"]
colors = ["green", "blue", "orange"]
explode = [0, 0, 0.1] # to highlight the consumer section
